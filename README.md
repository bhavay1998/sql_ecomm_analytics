# Ecommerce and Web Analytics
This project is based on the Udemy course by John Pauler - <i>[Advanced SQL: MySQL for Ecommerce & Web Analytics](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-sql-mysql-for-analytics-business-intelligence/)</i>. <br>
The project assumes the role of a eCommerce database analyst for a newly launched eCommerce startup named <i>Maven Fuzzy Factory</i>. The project's primary focus is not only to 
develop advanced SQL queries, but to thoroughly emphasise the ´´´business logic´´´ behind it. 

## Objective
The aim of the project is to help the management (i.e. CEO, marketing director and website manager) grow the business and understand how to improve performance. Specifially, 

steer the business in the right direction, by assuming the role of a Web Analyst. Maven Fuzzy Factory is an online retailer that has just begun to generate sales. All analyses are performed by querying the ecommerce database using MySQL Client with Jupyter Notebooks. The entire code can be reproduced on MySQL Workbench.

## About the Database
The project is based on an eCommerce database built from scratch by John Pauler, member of the Maven Analytics team. Instead of working on random samples of data, the database is designed to closely mimic real-word eCommerce databases.

## Database Schema
The schema is stored in the project repository. It can also be visited with the link: <u> https://github.com/bhavay1998/Web_Analytics/blob/main/Schema.pdf </u>

## Project Highlights
The project begins with assisting the Marketing Director in optimising marketing channels through Traffic Source Analysis & Bid Optimization. Result:
- Marketing spent is justified for 'gsearch nonbrand' campaign, only for 'desktop' device
- Conversion Rate and Session Volume are the metrics used for this justification

The project concludes with assisting the Website Manager in website content analysis and A/B testing for landing page analysis. Result:
- Recommended a custom lander page since the bounce rate for the default lander page was unreasonably high (~60%)
- In an A/B test, custom lander performed better than the default lander (bounce rate ~53%)
- In a trend analysis, the business witnessed a reduction in the overall bounce rate for their website

## Project Code
The two code files *Traffic Source Analysis* and *Website Measurement & Testing* are present both in **PDF** and **Jupyter Notebook** formats in the project repository. The code was run on Jupyer Notebooks with MySQL client to make code output visible directly under the code cell. This makes the code easy to interpret.
